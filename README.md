# Emoji Generator
## Project Overview
Emojis have become a critical component of communication among global cultures. Some emojis function as words in online communication, others as mood modifiers or social cues. The assignment of emojis is not just descriptive, but prescriptive: Some emojis are designed to meet a language need, but others are designed without a specific need in mind and then pop culture invents a meaning. Consider the eggplant, the peach, the watermelon, the chair and more.  
 Do we need more emojis? ‘Need’ might be a strong word. But who knows what new cultural phenomenon can be birthed from the living organism of the internet, with some inspiration from our AI?
