# Emoji Generator
## Project Overview
Emojis are a critical component of modern communication, within and across all cultures. Emojis can serve as words, mood modifiers, or social cues. The assignment of emojis is not just descriptive, but prescriptive: Some emojis are designed to meet a language need, but others are generated without a specific need in mind and then the social organism of humanity invents a meaning. Consider the eggplant, the peach, the watermelon, the chair and more.  

Do we need more emojis? ‘Need’ might be a strong word. But who knows what new cultural phenomenon can be birthed from the living organism of the internet, with a kernel of inspiration from our Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network for emoji generation?

 Built for National Taiwan University's AI course, voted best project.
